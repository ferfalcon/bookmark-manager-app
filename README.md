![Design preview for the Bookmark manager app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

This is a solution to the [Bookmark manager app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-manager-app), an app with advanced filtering, tag system, and search. Implemented many-to-many database relationships, full-text search, and automatic metadata extraction from URLs.

## Overview

### Expected behavior

When adding a new bookmark, extract the site's favicon automatically based on the URL. How you save this is up to you. Alternatively, you can add a file upload input in the add/edit bookmark form to allow the user to add the favicon/logo manually.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add new bookmarks with a title, description, website URL, and tags
- View all their bookmarks
- See bookmark details including favicon, title, URL, description, tags, view count, last visited date, and date added
- Search for bookmarks by title in the search bar
- Filter bookmarks by selecting one or multiple tags from the sidebar
- Reset tag filters to view all bookmarks again
- View archived bookmarks
- Archive bookmarks to remove them from the main view without deleting them
- Pin/unpin bookmarks to keep important ones easily accessible
- Edit existing bookmarks to update their details
- Copy bookmark URLs to the clipboard
- Visit bookmarked websites directly from the app
- Sort bookmarks by "Recently added", "Recently visited", or "Most visited"
- Toggle between light and dark color themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
